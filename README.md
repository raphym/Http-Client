#HomeWork

A HTTP client that constructs an HTTP request based on userâ€™s command line input, sends
the request to a Web server, receives the reply from the server, and displays the reply
message on screen. You should support only IPv4 connections.


#The purpose of this project is two-fold:
- give students hand-on experience with socket programming, and
- help students better understand application-level protocols by implementing a
well-known protocol HTTP. In this programming assignment you will write HTTP
client. Students are not required to implement the full HTTP specification, but only a very
limited subset of it.
